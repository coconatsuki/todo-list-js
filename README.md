# Your todo-list

To launch the app:

```
yarn dev
```

## Actually working on: some bug that appears when removing the current active list.

When I first built this app, it was meant to practice React, ES6 and get used to webpack & babel & ESLint configuration.
I had to try, as much as possible, to separate(in different modules) my application logic from the DOM-related methods.

For this first step, the most difficult for me was to use the localStorage to store list and task Json objets,
and then to render them again in the html page.

Then, I transformed everything into a React app, and it was so easier!

It was my first time to use React, and I definitly love it.
