# Your todo-list

This app was meant to practice ES6 and get used to webpack & babel & ESLint configuration.
I had to try, as much as possible, to separate(in different modules) my application logic from the DOM-related methods.

One of the most difficult step for me was to use the localStorage to store list and task Json objets,
and then to render them again in the html page.
